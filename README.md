## **Machine Learning**
This assignment is about evaluating several machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem, so I used different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. 
I used the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

### **Resampling**
